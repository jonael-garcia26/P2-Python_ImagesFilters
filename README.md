# Image Filters - Python Project #2
Use of numpy and pillow

## This project was a work in pairs in which we had to manipulate the pixels of photos and create different types of filters such as:
- invert colors
- make photo blurry
- flip photo vertically
- invert photo horizontally
- make a tile filter
